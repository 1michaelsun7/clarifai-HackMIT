## Welcome Hackers!

We are thrilled to offer you early access to the Clarifai Custom Model Training APIs. These APIs have never been used outside of our walls so we can't wait to see what awesome hacks are built on top of them. 

**Please note:** The API endpoint is https://api**-alpha**.clarifai.com. It's important to use this and not our production endpoint.
