# clarifai-HackMIT

## Welcome Hackers!

We are thrilled to offer you early access to the Clarifai Custom Model Training APIs. These APIs have never been used outside of our walls so we can't wait to see what awesome hacks are built on top of them. 

**Please note:** The API endpoint is https://api**-alpha**.clarifai.com. It's important to use this and not our production endpoint. 

## Signup

Before you begin, please make sure to signup at the special  [HackMIT 2015 Clarifai Signup Page](https://developer-alpha.clarifai.com/signup/HackMIT). This will give you free access to our alpha API. 

## Getting Started

Have a look at [custom-training.md](custom-training.md).That document explains what Custom Training is all about and why it's so cool.

Next have a look at our [Javascript](javascript) and [Python](python) examples. These should help you get started in coding up your beauty. The [data directory](data) has sample .tsv files with a few hundred urls for images that you may find useful.

## Help

If you need anyhelp at all, please email us (support@clarifai.com), Tweet at us [@clarifaidev](https://twitter.com/clarifaidev) or find one of us at the hackathon (we sent a squad!).

Have fun and good luck!
